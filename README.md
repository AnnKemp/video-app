## Photogallery app in Ionic

The great thing about Ionic is that with one codebase, you can build for any platform using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow along as we learn the fundamentals of Ionic app development by creating a realistic app step by step.

## What We'll Build
We'll create a Photo Gallery app that offers the ability to take photos with your device's camera, display them in a grid, and store them permanently on the device.

Highlights include:

One Angular-based codebase that runs on the web, iOS, and Android using Ionic Framework UI components.
Deployed as a native iOS and Android mobile app using Capacitor, Ionic's official native app runtime.
Photo Gallery functionality powered by the Capacitor Camera, Filesystem, and Storage APIs.


## Download required tools
Download and install these right away to ensure an optimal Ionic development experience:

Node.js for interacting with the Ionic ecosystem. Download the LTS version here.
A code editor for... writing code! We are fans of Visual Studio Code.
Command-line interface/terminal (CLI):
Windows users: for the best Ionic experience, we recommend the built-in command line (cmd) or the Powershell CLI, running in Administrator mode.
Mac/Linux users, virtually any terminal will work.

## Install Ionic tooling
Run the following in the command line terminal to install the Ionic CLI (ionic), native-run, used to run native binaries on devices and simulators/emulators, and cordova-res, used to generate native app icons and splash screens:

To open a terminal in Visual Studio Code, go to Terminal -> New Terminal. The code in terminal:

npm install -g @ionic/cli native-run cordova-res

The -g option means install globally. When packages are installed globally, EACCES permission errors can occur.

Consider setting up npm to operate globally without elevated permissions. See Resolving Permission Errors for more information.
